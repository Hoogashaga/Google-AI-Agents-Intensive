What languages is the SDK available in?\nhelpful_assistant > The Agent Development Kit (ADK) from Google is a flexible, modular, open-source framework designed to simplify the full-stack development, deployment, and orchestration of AI agents and multi-agent systems. It applies software development principles to AI agent creation, aiming to make it easier for developers to build production-ready agentic applications with greater control and flexibility. ADK is optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem but is model-agnostic and compatible with other frameworks.\n\nKey features of ADK include:\n*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Building modular and scalable applications by composing specialized agents in a hierarchy.\n*   **Flexible Orchestration:** Defining workflows using specialized agents for predictable pipelines or leveraging LLM-driven dynamic routing for adaptive behavior.\n*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Equipping agents with pre-built tools (e.g., Search, Code Execution), custom functions, integration with third-party libraries, or even using other agents as tools.\n*   **Code-First Development:** Defining agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in code for better debugging, versioning, and deployment.\n*   **Deployment Ready:** Containerizing and deploying agents anywhere, with specific optimization for Google Cloud services like Vertex AI Agent Engine Runtime.\n*   **Integrated Developer Experience:** Offering a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a visual Web User Interface (UI) for local development, testing, and debugging.\n*   **Built-in Evaluation:** Systematically assessing agent performance.\n\nThe SDK is available in the following languages:\n*   **Python**\n*   **Java**\n*   **Go**\n\nSupport for more languages is planned.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = await runner.run_debug(\"What's the weather in London?\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T04:08:56.463033Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T04:08:56.463412Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T04:08:58.721667Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-10T04:08:56.463388Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T04:08:58.720757Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n ### Continue session: debug_session_id\n\nUser > What's the weather in London?\nhelpful_assistant > Currently in London, it is cloudy with a temperature of 56°F (13°C).

What if there was a way to break down complex problems into smaller, intelligent, and cooperative units? Enter Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a paradigm shift that's revolutionizing how software is built and managed.\n\n**Main Section 1: What Exactly ARE Multi-Agent Systems?**\n\n*   **Decentralized Intelligence:** Explore the core concept of MAS – individual, autonomous \"agents\" that interact and cooperate to achieve a common goal or individual objectives.\n*   **Beyond Traditional Programming:** Differentiate MAS from standard object-oriented or procedural programming, highlighting the emergent behavior and distributed decision-making.\n*   **Real-World Analogies:** Briefly touch upon examples like ant colonies or human teams to make the concept more relatable.\n\n**Main Section 2: The Developer's Advantage: How MAS Simplifies Complexity**\n\n*   **Modularity and Reusability:** Explain how breaking down a system into agents promotes smaller, focused code modules that are easier to develop, test, and reuse across different projects.\n*   **Enhanced Scalability:** Discuss how MAS can naturally scale horizontally by adding more agents, rather than requiring complex re-architecture of a single, large system.\n*   **Improved Fault Tolerance and Resilience:** Detail how the failure of one agent doesn't necessarily bring down the entire system, leading to more robust applications.\n\n**Main Section 3: Practical Benefits for Your Development Workflow**\n\n*   **Simplified Debugging:** Show how isolating issues to specific agents can drastically reduce debugging time and effort compared to tracing problems in a monolithic application.\n*   **Parallel Processing Power:** Highlight the inherent ability of MAS to leverage multi-core processors and distributed computing environments for faster execution.\n*   **Adaptability and Flexibility:** Discuss how agents can be easily updated, replaced, or added to modify system behavior without impacting other parts of the application.\n\n**Main Section 4: Getting Started with Multi-Agent Systems (Optional, depending on desired depth)**\n\n*   **Key Concepts to Grasp:** Briefly mention concepts like agent communication languages (ACLs), negotiation, and coordination mechanisms.\n*   **Tools and Frameworks:** Hint at existing libraries or platforms that facilitate MAS development (e.g., JADE, SPADE, or specialized AI frameworks).\n*   **The Learning Curve:** Acknowledge that there's a learning curve but emphasize the long-term rewards.\n\n**Concluding Thought:** Multi-Agent Systems offer a powerful and elegant approach to tackling complex software challenges. By embracing this paradigm, developers can build more robust, scalable, and maintainable applications, ultimately leading to more efficient development cycles and higher-quality software. It's time to move beyond the monolith and explore the collaborative intelligence of agents.\nWriterAgent > ## Supercharge Your Code: Unlocking the Power of Multi-Agent Systems for Developers\n\nAre you wrestling with monolithic codebases that feel like digital quicksand? Imagine a world where complex problems are broken down into smaller, intelligent, and cooperative units. Welcome to the realm of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a revolutionary approach that's reshaping software development.\n\nAt its core, MAS involves individual, autonomous \"agents\" that communicate and collaborate to achieve shared goals. Think of it like an ant colony, where each ant performs a specific task, collectively building a sophisticated structure. This decentralized intelligence stands in contrast to traditional programming, where emergent behavior and distributed decision-making lead to more dynamic systems.\n\nThe benefits for developers are profound. MAS champions **modularity and reusability**, allowing you to create focused, manageable code components. Need to scale? MAS excels with **enhanced scalability**, where you can simply add more agents to handle increased load, rather than undertaking massive re-architectures. Crucially, **improved fault tolerance** means the failure of one agent doesn't crash your entire application.\n\nYour development workflow will thank you. **Debugging becomes a breeze** as you can isolate issues to specific agents. MAS naturally lends itself to **parallel processing**, leveraging modern hardware for faster execution. Furthermore, systems built with MAS are inherently **adaptable and flexible**, allowing for easy updates and modifications without disrupting the whole.\n\nWhile there's a learning curve involving concepts like agent communication languages, the payoff in building robust, scalable, and maintainable applications is undeniable. It’s time to explore the collaborative intelligence of agents and supercharge your code.\nEditorAgent > ## Supercharge Your Code: Unlocking the Power of Multi-Agent Systems for Developers\n\nAre you wrestling with monolithic codebases that feel like digital quicksand, becoming increasingly difficult to manage, scale, and debug? Imagine a world where complex problems are elegantly broken down into smaller, intelligent, and cooperative units. Welcome to the realm of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a revolutionary approach that's reshaping the landscape of software development.\n\nAt its core, MAS involves individual, autonomous \"agents\" that communicate and collaborate to achieve shared goals. Think of it like a highly efficient ant colony, where each ant performs a specific task, and together they collectively build a sophisticated structure. This paradigm of decentralized intelligence stands in stark contrast to traditional programming models, fostering emergent behavior and distributed decision-making that lead to more dynamic and resilient systems.\n\nThe benefits for developers are profound. MAS champions **modularity and reusability**, allowing you to create focused, manageable code components that are easier to develop, test, and redeploy. Need to scale your application? MAS excels with **enhanced scalability**, where you can simply add more agents to handle increased load, rather than undertaking massive, disruptive re-architectures. Crucially, MAS offers **improved fault tolerance**, meaning the failure of one agent doesn't necessarily bring down your entire application, leading to significantly more robust software.\n\nYour development workflow will also experience a welcome transformation. **Debugging becomes a breeze** as you can often isolate issues to specific agents, drastically reducing troubleshooting time and effort. MAS naturally lends itself to **parallel processing**, allowing you to effectively leverage modern multi-core processors and distributed computing environments for faster execution. Furthermore, systems built with MAS are inherently **adaptable and flexible**, allowing for straightforward updates and modifications without cascading disruptions to the entire system.\n\nWhile there's a learning curve involved, particularly in understanding concepts like agent communication languages and coordination mechanisms, the payoff in building robust, scalable, and maintainable applications is undeniable.
